# ft_Printf

About the project:

-> ft_printf is a project that mimics the real printf function.

Although wide in scope, it’s not a difficult project.


-> This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

You have to recode the printf() function from libc.

    The prototype of ft_printf() is:
    
     int ft_printf(const char *, ...);


This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
information below) of the printf function.


🛠️ Usage
Requirements
The function is written in C language and thus needs the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.

Instructions
1. Compiling the library

To compile, go to the library path and run:

$ make

2. Using it in your code

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

#include "ft_printf.h"
